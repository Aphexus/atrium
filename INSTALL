Installation
============
We use our own in-house building toolchain based on Cook,
super-fast caching incremental build tool, created specially 
for D projects. Please visit project page for details:
http://code.google.com/p/cook-build-automation-tool. 

Prerequisites
============
- Up-to-date D2 compiler. We recommend newest version of DMD or LDC;
- Phobos standard library;
- Cook build automation utility. We provide precompiled binaries
  for Cook bundled with the project. You may also build
  it from source by yourself (cook-0.9.2-src).

DMD path
============
To compile Atrium with DMD, please change path to compiler 
executable directory in default.conf file.
Under Linux:

 linux.compiler_dir: "/path/to/dmd2-2.060/linux";

Under Windows:

 windows.compiler_dir: "C:/path/to/dmd2/windows";

Then cd to project root directory and run Cook.

LDC path
============
To compile Atrium with LDC, please change path to compiler 
executable directory in ldc-linux.conf file.

 linux.compiler_dir: "/path/to/ldc2-0.10.0-linux-x86";

Then cd to project root directory and do

 $ ./cook -dc ldc-linux.conf

N.B.: Is LDC Linux-only? Not sure, haven't tested on Windows yet... :(
