Atrium
======
The goal of this project is to create a first-person shooter with physics based puzzles, entirely in [D language](http://dlang.org).

Gameplay
========
Atrium will provide high level of interactivity, featuring fully dynamic world with everything being controlled by the physics engine. You will be able to walk on any surface and push any object, use special devices to affect gravity and other physical behaviours of the environment. The gameplay will be peaceful and non-violent: explore the world, solve  the puzzles and unleash the mysteries.

Tech details
============
Atrium uses OpenGL for rendering, thus (theoretically) supporting all platforms that provide OpenGL API. Main target platforms for now are Windows and Linux. Currently Atrium is tested and known to work on Ubuntu 8.10, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (32-bit).

The project is written in D2 using Phobos and requires up-to-date D compiler (DMD or LDC). To build Atrium, follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.
